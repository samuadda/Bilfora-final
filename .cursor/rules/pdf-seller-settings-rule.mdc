Invoice PDFs must use a single source of truth for seller data.

The invoice detail page is responsible for fetching:
- invoice
- client
- invoice items
- invoice_settings (seller name, VAT number, CR, address, logo, IBAN, defaults)

The PDF renderer MUST receive seller data only via the `invoice_settings` object.
Hardcoded sellerInfo constants are forbidden anywhere in the codebase.

PDF components must never fetch data themselves or construct seller data.
They are pure renderers only.
