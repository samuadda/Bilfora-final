Bilfora uses Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase.

Enforce strict boundaries:
- app/ = routing and composition only
- components/ = presentational UI only
- features/<domain>/ = business logic, schemas, repos
- lib/ = framework integrations only
- types/ = shared types

Pages must not contain business logic or raw Supabase queries.
